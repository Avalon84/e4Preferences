e4Preferences
=============

Some code to manage preferencePage with an extension point (as in Eclipse 3).

This new release is updated **to mix both E3 and E4 preference pages.** So you can define pure E4 preference pages in a plug-in, and launch your plugin either in a pure E4 application or in a compatibility runtime.

You can get some explainations <a href="http://www.opcoach.com/en/managing-preference-pages-with-eclipse-4/">on my blog</a>

This code is available on this p2 repository : https://www.opcoach.com/repository/2019-12 (use the com.opcoach.e4.preferences.feature.feature.group)
